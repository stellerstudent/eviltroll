# Eviltroll
Eviltroll is a script that does a bunch of annoying stuff to any osx computer. Kinda fun to disguise as a word document and share it to people. :P

### Stuff that it does
Currently you can do any or all of these things:
1. Launch a ton of apps and relaunch them when the user quits them.
2. Take a screenshot of the screen after quitting all apps, set it as the background, and then hide the dock.
3. Open http://hurr-durr.com and reopens it when user quits Safari
4. Shuts down the computer

#### Enjoy!
Please post issues or pull requests if you have ideas for new stuff!
